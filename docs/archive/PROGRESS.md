## 0. Pending after `Patches` branch (2026-04-27)

Code-review of merge `c621600` (PR #3, "Applied robot vision") flagged regressions and follow-ups. The reversible/dev-machine fixes landed on branch `Patches`. The items below remain **open** and require either lab access or a team decision before closing:

**Hardware-blocked (need D415 / QArm / Simulink):**
- `matlab_facade/py_detect_live.m:85` calls `fruit_detector.detect_and_project(...)` which was removed by PR #3. Decision needed: retire the MATLAB live-detect path, or restore a `detect_and_project` shim against the new `session_cal` projection. Either way verification needs Simulink + D415.
- 5 legacy diagnostic scripts depend on the old detector API and will fail at import: `python/analyze_static.py`, `python/analyze_detections.py`, `python/hover_test.py`, `python/recal_from_pose.py`, `python/test_auto_pick.py`. Migrating them is mechanical, but verifying that the migrated outputs match the originals needs the lab rig.
- End-to-end validation that the new `pick_single` empirical X-bias (`PICK_BIAS_X = 0.05` m) is still correct after recalibration, and is in fact a per-rig constant rather than a per-session one.
- HSV / shape thresholds in `fruit_detector.py` were tuned for the 2026-04-22 lighting and chessboard distance; needs lab confirmation under final-demo conditions.
- Live D415 feed during pick (Patches: 2026-04-27): with arm + D415 + `main_final.py` running, click a fruit and confirm (a) the picker window keeps refreshing the live POV during the ~10 s arm motion, (b) the status overlay shows the FSM state transitioning GO_HOME → APPROACH → DESCEND → CLOSE_GRIPPER → ASCEND_PICK, (c) clicks during pick are ignored (no second pick queued), (d) after pick completes the window snaps back to the detection-overlay frame from `_refresh()`, (e) repeated picks don't leak threads — process should not accumulate camera handles. Failure modes to watch for: black frames (camera read race), Windows "Not Responding" on the OpenCV window (waitKey not pumping), arm pause >100 ms beyond expected (observer cost too high — would need to lower fps_limit).

## 0. Sprint state (2026-04-23)

**D3 complete** — picker_viewer + survey_capture + pick_single + main_final rewrite landed. Preflight swapped UGreen/VisualRef for session_cal + chessboard-still-visible. MATLAB facade demo queue gutted. Pending: D4 lab tuning of HSV, first end-to-end pick test (D4 AM).

Test suites:
- test_integration.py (FSM regressions) — still green
- test_pick_single.py (3 new tests) — green
- test_survey_capture.py (3 new tests) — green
- test_picker_viewer.py (8 new tests) — green

---

## 0. Sprint state (2026-04-20)

Phase A of `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-04-20-final-sprint.md` **complete through A7.5** (all dev-machine work). Phase B awaits lab session access.

Test suites all green:
- `test_integration.py` — **14/14** (FSM cycles, IK safety, gripper ramp, quintic boundaries, remote jog clamps, trace events)
- `test_ugreen_tracker.py` — **7/7** (image-diff TCP, baseline roundtrip, intrinsics IO, component selection, global-shift rejection)
- `test_calibrate_closed_loop.py` — **2/2** (PnP recovery, near-coplanar robustness)

Key findings from prior sessions now reflected in code:
- **D415 is arm-mounted**: `T_cam_to_base` is pose-dependent. `main_final.py` moves to `pickhome1` before detecting.
- **UGreen floor camera** integrated: `python/ugreen_tracker.py` extracts TCP via image diff, `calibrate_closed_loop.py` solves hand-eye via SQPnP + iterative refine, with a sanity gate (50 mm hard limit → `.rejected.json`, 20 mm warn → `status: warning`).
- **Gripper ramp + readback** shared between autonomous FSM and remote jog via `set_gripper_ramp` on `FruitSortingController`.

New modules this sprint:
- `python/trace_logger.py` — extracted from `teach_points.py`; emits PICK_ATTEMPT / GRIPPER_READBACK / SORT_COMPLETE.
- `python/ugreen_tracker.py`, `python/ugreen_intrinsics.py`, `python/calibrate_closed_loop.py`.
- `python/remote_jog.py`, `python/remote_view.py`, `python/preflight.py`.
- `scripts/generate_report_plots.py`, `scripts/print_chessboard.py`.
- `matlab_facade/py_remote_view.m`, `matlab_facade/build_autonomous_stateflow.m`, `matlab_facade/build_hardware_model_v2.m`, `matlab_facade/remote_hmi.md`.
- `LAB_RUNBOOK.md` at repo root.

## 1. Task recap (coursework brief)

Sort **14 fruits** with a Quanser QArm (4-DOF) + Intel RealSense D415:

| Fruit       | Count | Target basket |
|-------------|-------|---------------|
| Strawberry  | 6     | Basket A      |
| Banana      | 3     | Basket B      |
| Tomato      | 5     | Basket C      |

Two operating modes required by the rubric:
- **Autonomous** — full vision → plan → pick → place loop.
- **Remote-controlled** — human teleop fallback.

Hardware baseline: QArm 4-DOF serial arm, D415 RGB-D camera, Quanser SDK for Windows.

---

## 2. Architectural decision (locked)

> **Simulink is the facade. Python does the real work.**

This is the user's explicit requirement and overrides the shape of the original repo (which is 100% Python with orphan `.m` files). We do **not** rewrite Python; we wrap it.

- **Python core** (untouched unless asked): kinematics, detector, driver, controller, trajectory.
- **Simulink facade** (`matlab_facade/`): `.slx` models whose MATLAB Function blocks call Python via `py.*` / `coder.extrinsic`. No TCP bridge, no socket shim — direct in-process calls.
- **Solver:** fixed-step `ode4`, `dt = 0.002 s` (500 Hz) — matches Python loop rate so behavior stays consistent across both domains.
- **Feedback loops** broken with `Unit Delay` blocks to avoid algebraic-loop errors.

Vertical-slice discipline: build one subsystem → simulate → validate → add the next. No big-bang integration.

---

## 3. Environment (verified 2026-04-14)

| Component | Status | Path / Version |
|-----------|--------|----------------|
| MATLAB    | ✅ R2025a (Simulink, Simscape, Stateflow) | `C:\Program Files\MATLAB\R2025a` |
| Python    | ⚠️ 3.13.5 — pyenv warns "not officially supported" but calls work | `C:\Python313\python.exe` |
| Quanser SDK (Windows) | ✅ installed | `C:\Program Files\Quanser\Quanser SDK\` |
| **QUARC** | ❌ **NOT installed** — Simulink cannot talk to QArm natively | lab machine only |
| Python deps | ✅ `quanser.hardware`, `quanser.devices`, `numpy 2.4`, `opencv 4.13` import cleanly | — |
| MATLAB MCP server | ✅ v0.7.0, registered as `matlab` (stdio, nodesktop) | `%USERPROFILE%\.claude\tools\matlab-mcp-core-server.exe` |

**MCP tools available:** `detect_matlab_toolboxes`, `check_matlab_code`, `evaluate_matlab_code`, `run_matlab_file`, `run_matlab_test_file`. No Simulink-specific MCP tools — Simulink work is driven by writing `.m` build scripts and evaluating them.

**Consequence of no QUARC on dev machine:** all hardware I/O must route through `py.qarm_driver.QArmDriver`. Simulink never touches the arm directly. `py_qarm_io.m` has three modes:
- `mode=0` **SIMULATE** (default) — echoes commanded joints, no driver instantiation.
- `mode=1` **HARDWARE** — real QArm via Python driver.
- `mode=2` **RELEASE** — shutdown / safe.

## 5. Vertical slices — status matrix

| # | Slice | Model | Build script | Run script | Status | Evidence |
|---|-------|-------|--------------|------------|--------|----------|
| 1 | **IK bridge** | `FruitSorting_slice.slx` | `build_slice_IK.m` | `run_slice_IK.m` | ✅ **PASS** | joint vector from `py.qarm_kinematics.inverse_kinematics` propagates through MATLAB Function block end-to-end |
| 2 | **Vision** | `FruitSorting_slice_vision.slx` | `build_slice_vision.m` | `run_slice_vision.m` | ✅ **PASS** | Synthetic BGR image → 1 banana + 1 tomato + 1 strawberry detected, fixed 8×5 output shape |
| 3 | **FSM / controller** | `FruitSorting_slice_fsm.slx` | `build_slice_fsm.m` | `run_slice_fsm.m` | ✅ **PASS** | 601 ticks, all 11/11 states visited, `DONE` reached |
| 4 | **Kinematics + trajectory integration** | — | — | — | ⚠️ **merged into slice 5** (not a standalone slice) | — |
| 5 | **Top-level hardware model** | `FruitSorting_Hardware.slx` | `build_hardware_model.m` | `run_FruitSorting.m` | ✅ **PASS (sim)** | FSM → QArmIO → feedback loop, `qarm_mode` Constant gates sim vs hardware |

**All five slices validated in simulation as of 2026-04-14.** No slice currently exercises real hardware.

## 6. Key implementation notes

### 6.1 `sorting_controller_sim.py` (new file)

A dt-driven twin of `sorting_controller.py` with:
- No `time.time()` calls — receives `dt` from Simulink.
- Integer state IDs `0..11` exported as `state_id` output port (readable by Stateflow / logs).
- Same transition logic as the original; original file left untouched so `main_remote.py` and CLI flows still work.

Driven from MATLAB via `py_controller.m`, which holds a **persistent handle** to `py.sorting_controller_sim.StepController` so state survives between Simulink ticks:

```
(joints_cur, dt, reset)  →  (phi[4], gripper, state_id, done)
```

### 6.2 `py_detect_test.m`

Builds a synthetic BGR test image, calls `py.fruit_detector.detect_fruits`, returns a **fixed-size** `8×5` matrix `[type_id, cy, cx, area, conf]` padded with zeros plus a `count` scalar. Fixed shape is required by MATLAB Function block output signatures.

### 6.3 `py_qarm_io.m`

Persistent QArmDriver facade. Default mode `0` (SIMULATE) simply echoes the commanded joints — works on any machine without QUARC/Quanser hardware. Mode `1` instantiates the real driver; mode `2` releases it cleanly.

---

## 7. Gotchas learned (hard-won, do not re-pay)

1. **Python 3.13 pyenv warning is harmless for our calls.** If it ever bites, install Python 3.12 and repoint `setup_pyenv.m`.
2. **`forward_kinematics` returns a Python tuple** `(pos, R)`. In MATLAB unpack via `cell(tup)` — not indexing.
3. **MATLAB Function blocks calling Python need:**
   - `coder.extrinsic('py.module.func')`
   - Pre-declared output sizes (`phi = zeros(4,1)`)
   - Explicit `double()` cast on extrinsic returns — **without the cast the values don't propagate to output ports**. Lost a full slice-1 iteration to this.
4. **`To Workspace` in Array format** logs vector signals as `[signal_dim × 1 × N_samples]` 3-D arrays. Always `squeeze(x)'` before indexing.
5. **Constant block `OutMin`/`OutMax` must be scalar doubles.** Vector limits fail at build time.
6. **Feedback loops require `Unit Delay`** to break algebraic loops (applied on both the FSM slice and the top-level model).
7. **Controller must use accumulated sim time**, not `time.time()`. Mixing the two makes dt-driven transitions misfire.
8. **HSV thresholds, `T_cam_to_base`, and basket world coordinates are all placeholders** — cannot be tuned without real camera and robot base frame.

---

## 8. Pending work

### 8.1 Lab-only (blocking final submission)

1. **Install QUARC** on the lab machine. Set `qarm_mode` Constant in `FruitSorting_Hardware.slx` to `1` and verify `py_qarm_io` hardware path end-to-end. Dry-run first with arm powered but base unclamped.
2. **Replace hardcoded demo fruit queue** in `py_controller.m` with positions from the vision pipeline. Requires:
   - `T_cam_to_base` extrinsic calibration (hand-eye).
   - Live D415 frames routed through `py.camera.get_frame`.
3. **Tune `fruit_detector.HSV_RANGES` + `CIRCULARITY_THRESH`** on the real camera feed under lab lighting. Current values were hand-picked for the synthetic test image.
4. **Integrate the vision subsystem into the top-level model.** Slice 2 is currently standalone; `FruitSorting_Hardware.slx` uses a mocked fruit list.

### 8.2 Dev-machine (can be done before lab day)

5. **Wire vision → planner in Simulink** even with mocked frames, so the lab visit only has to swap in real frames, not restructure wiring.
6. **Add a Stateflow chart** mirroring `sorting_controller_sim` states so the FSM is visible/editable in Simulink (currently the FSM is a MATLAB Function block + persistent handle — rubric may expect a visible Stateflow diagram).
7. **Remote-control mode** — not yet present in the facade. `main_remote.py` exists but is not called from any `.slx`. Decide whether to expose teleop through a MATLAB Function block or leave it as a pure Python entry point and document it in the report.
8. **Trajectory smoothing** — `trajectory.py` has a quintic planner but `py_controller.m` currently issues raw joint targets. Integrate so motion is smoother and jerk-limited.
9. **Logging / plots** — add `To Workspace` logging on every slice for the report figures. Currently only slices 1/3 log.
10. **Risk assessment form** — `Risk-Assessment-Form-AR - 2024-2025.docx` is unfilled. Required deliverable.

### 8.3 Report & deliverables

11. Final report PDF (team deliverable, not yet drafted).
12. Demo video (autonomous + remote), rubric asks for both modes.
13. **`COMPLETE_GUIDE.md` is drafted** but needs a refresh after slice 5 passed.
14. `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` is the canonical session-loader — keep it and `PROGRESS.md` in sync.

---

## 9. Known environmental issues (unrelated to project code)

- **npm is corrupted** on the dev machine: `%APPDATA%\npm\node_modules\npm\...\@npmcli\fs\lib\common\` is missing `node.js`, so `npx -y ...` fails with `MODULE_NOT_FOUND`. This breaks npx-based MCP servers (`sequential-thinking`, `context7`). Fix plan: delete the broken user-prefix npm and reinstall via the bundled `C:\Program Files\nodejs\npm.cmd`. Pending user approval — **does not affect MATLAB/Python pipeline**, only Claude Code tooling.
- `context7` MCP server is **not declared** in `~/.claude.json`; must be added after npm is repaired.
- `sequential-thinking` is declared at user scope but cannot start until npm is repaired.

---

## 10. How to resume next session (checklist)

1. Open Claude Code in this working directory.
2. Auto-memory will load `project_fruitsorting.md` — confirms high-level state.
3. Read `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` and **this file (`PROGRESS.md`)** for the full snapshot.
4. If running MATLAB: start MATLAB R2025a, `cd` to `FinalProject_FruitSorting/matlab_facade`, run `setup_pyenv`, then any `run_slice_*.m` / `run_FruitSorting.m`.
5. If doing lab work: bring a USB with the repo, install QUARC on the lab PC, then follow §8.1 in order.

## 11. Timeline to deadline

| Date | Milestone |
|------|-----------|
| **2026-04-14** (today) | All 5 sim slices PASS. Facade architecture locked. |
| 2026-04-15 → 2026-04-21 | Dev-machine pending items §8.2 (#5–#10). Draft report skeleton. |
| 2026-04-22 → 2026-04-28 | **Lab week** — execute §8.1 (#1–#4). Record demo video. |
| 2026-04-29 → 2026-04-30 | Final report pass, risk assessment, polish. Buffer day. |
| **2026-05-01 14:00** | **Submission deadline.** |

**17 calendar days remain.** Lab access is the critical-path bottleneck — every lab-only item must be done on real hardware, so the lab week cannot slip.
